# Brick-Pop
Brick Pop Solver and GUI

To run the GUI, just run the executable brickPop.jar file.

This GUI allows you to choose an image file containing a brick pop board and process it accordingly. Then, you can experiment with the board
and/or let the computer solve it. Then, you will be given a walkthrough solution to either the solution you or the computer came up with.
